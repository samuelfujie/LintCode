# 57. 3Sum
[ https://www.lintcode.com/problem/3sum/description ]

Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that `a + b + c = 0`? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

## Example
**Example 1:**

Input:
```sh
[2,7,11,15]
```
Output:
```sh
[]
```

**Example 2:**

Input:
```sh
[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
```
Output:
```sh
[[-1, 0, 1],[-1, -1, 2]]
```

## Notice
- Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c)
- The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
