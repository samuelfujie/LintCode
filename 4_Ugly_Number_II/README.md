# 4. Ugly Number II
[ https://www.lintcode.com/problem/ugly-number-ii/description ]

Ugly number is a number that only have prime factors `2`, `3` and `5`.

Design an algorithm to find the nth ugly number. The first 10 ugly numbers are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12...`

## Example
**Example 1:**

Input:
```sh
9
```
Output:
```sh
10
```

**Example 2:**

Input:
```sh
1
```
Output:
```sh
1
```

## Challenge
O(n log n) or O(n) time.

## Notice
Note that `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
