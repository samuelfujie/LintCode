# 433. Number of Islands
[ https://www.lintcode.com/problem/number-of-islands/description ]

Given a boolean 2D matrix, `0` is represented as the sea, `1` is represented as the island. If two 1 is adjacent, we consider them in the same island. We only consider up/down/left/right adjacent.

Find the number of islands.
